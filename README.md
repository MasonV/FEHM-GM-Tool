# FEHM-GM-Tool

The main benifits of the tool in its early state is simply reading and parsing the players, statistics, and staff.ehm file. After importing the files you can copy and paste the resutlt into a Excel or an alternative to manipulate data. 

#Importin League Data

1. Download the files
2. Run the application (FEHM GM.exe)
3. Click the big "Import New League" Button, or alternatively File --> New League

At this point the Import screen will pop up. The screen still has the very simple debugger which will hopefully not display much information for you. 

4. Enter a league name (this will be what the database is called)
5. Click the "Import Data" button. If it's grayed out, simply move your mouse out of the league name box. 
6. Use the folder selection dialog that pops up to select the folder where the league files are (players.ehm, etc.) & hit ok. 

At this point the program will work through the different files. When it is compelte a messagebox will pop up and say its done, and load the main form were the data is then displayed.

**If the program runs into problems parsing the league files, please send a copy of them to me so I can make the appropriate changes.

Other Notes: This is my first C# application, and I built this over the weekend. This is not a refined end application, this is very much an alpha build and a minimum viable product.
